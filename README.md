# ASL to text using tensor flow

make sure to download the data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet and train the model on it

We created this project in order to translate ASL hand symbols and output what the letter is. The project succeeds in being able to do this, but lacks some of the accuracy that we desired, which would be doable with being trained on a larger data set. Otherwise, the program works as intended and trains a model using tensor flow to detect hand signals and classify them to the english alphabet
